Cooking is an integral part of every home's life. Being able to quickly decide what to have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and with a click to find a recipe that complies with your current diet, is the dream of every family. If you want to develop an application that can make millions of people happy by saving them time for their close ones, you are in the right spot.

With Neo4j, you can quickly graph a use case, fill it with real world objects, and enjoy the interconnectedness of your data.

Let me show you how easy it is to model a domain such as Food Recipes.

== Step 1: Create a Pancakes Recipe Model
[[anchor-1]]

The first thing you have to do is to find a recipe that you like and to write down its main parts. They will be your graph nodes: _pancake_, _almond flour_
_coconut flour_, _eggs_, _baking powder_, _vanilla extract_, _avocado oil_,
_sea salt_, _recipe_, _nutrition facts_, _instructions_.

Then, try to identify how these parts interact with each other, for example, _pancake contains almond flour_, _recipe has nutrition facts_, _recipe is about pancakes_, _recipe starts with instruction_, _instruction 1 is followed by instruction 2_, _the last instruction produces food_. Continue until it feels complete.

*Tip:* The more connected your model is, the more possibilities you have to traverse it.
========

== Step 2: Add Labels and Properties
[[anchor-2]]

When you are done with your graph nodes and relationships, you label them and define them by using the so called properties. You know that pancakes are food but they can also be used for making a cake. So, you add two labels next to _pancake_: _food_ and _ingredient_. Then, you connect the pancake to its ingredients by adding the relationship _contains_. You can further model the link by assigning the property _quantity:_ to it, which can be also related to the recipe. Then, you define the node _recipe_ by adding the following properties:

[source]
----
name:'Pancakes',
suitable_for:'HFLC',
course:'breakfast',
calories:'268 kcal',
prep_time:'5 min',
cook_time:'15 min',
servings:'6'
----
Continue like this until you define every node of you graph.

*Note:* For the example purposes, I have not added all domain connections and nodes because the graph would have become very complex.

== Step 3: Import the Graph Model in Neo4j
[[anchor-3]]

Now, you can use http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/#[Arrow Tool] to create the graph model of your recipe by adding the nodes and relationships from <<anchor-1,Step 1>> and <<anchor-1,2>>. The *Export Cypher* option creates a query that you can use to import the graph in the Neo4j database.

== Step 4: Show All Nodes and Relationships
[[anchor-4]]

You can visualise your graph by using the following query.

[source,sql]
----
MATCH p = (n)-->() RETURN p
----

image::{imagesdir}/graph.png[]

If your model needs improving, follow the example in <<anchor-1,Step 3>> and modify the code in a text editor. Visualise again. Repeat.

== Step 5: Show Domain Schema
[[anchor-5]]

Finally, you come to the point where you can extract your graph schema and apply it to other recipes to grow your database.

[source,sql]
----
call db.schema()

== Let's See What You Can Learn from the Data

You can use Cypher queries to retrieve knowledge from your data.

*You: Neo4j, show me the Nutrition Facts of the "Pancakes" recipe*

[source, sql]
----
MATCH (:Recipe {name: 'Pancakes'})-[:has_nutrition_facts]->(n:Nutrition_Facts)
RETURN n.`serving_size`,n.`calories`,n.`fat`,n.`protein`,n.`total carbs`
----

*Neo4j:*

image::{imagesdir}/recipe_nutrition_facts.png[]

*You: Neo4j, give me the ingredients of a pancake*

[source,sql]
----
MATCH (food:Food)-[:contains]->(Ingredient)
RETURN food.name AS Food, collect(Ingredient.name) AS Ingredients
----

*Neo4j:*

image::{imagesdir}/recipe_ingredients.png[]

*You: Neo4j, give me the quantity of each ingredient*

**Query**

[source,sql]
----
MATCH (food:Food)-[c:contains]-> (i:Ingredient)
RETURN  i.name AS Ingredient,c.quantity AS Quantity
ORDER BY c.quantity
----

*Neo4j:*

image::{imagesdir}/ingredient_quantity.png[]

*You: Neo4j, tell me how to prepare "Pancakes"*

[source,sql]
----
MATCH (r:Recipe)-[:starts_with]->(i:Instruction)-[:next_instruction*]->(i1)
RETURN r,i,i1
----

*Neo4j:*
